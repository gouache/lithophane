{"name":"Lithophane Creator","tagline":"A node.js command line utility to turn images (jpg/gif/png) into STL lithophanes for 3D printing","body":"### What is a lithophane?\r\n\r\nYou can read more here about the history of [Lithophanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithophane).\r\n\r\nBut this code is designed to let you use a 3D printer to create your own lithophanes from images.  How does this work?  Well, this code simply takes any image, calculates the grayscale value for each pixel, and then creates a 3D model that represents the extrusion of those grayscale values.  Not making sense?  Basically, it takes a flat image like this:\r\n\r\n![Reference Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubbahed/lithopane/master/reference.png)\r\n\r\nAnd turns it into this:\r\n\r\n![Lithophane STL in Blender](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wubbahed/lithophane/master/reference-as-lithophane.png)\r\n \r\n\r\n### How do I use this tool?\r\n\r\nOnce you've downloaded the source code, you'll need to make sure that all the dependencies are installed and setup.  First, you need to make sure libraries are installed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install get-pixels\r\n$ npm install commander\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, once you download the source code, you'll also need to make the lithophane.js file executable\r\n```\r\n$ chmod u+x lithophane.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you'll be able to call the function from the command line.\r\n```\r\n$ ./lithophane.js -i reference.png\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Support\r\nThis is a very early release of this, and it's definitely a work in progress with no warranties, so please send any feedback or comments to (@wubbahed).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
